/**
    A virtual (pinhole) camera.

    The camera is responsible for generating primary rays. It is positioned
    using a Transform and points along the -z axis of the local coordinate
    system. It has an image plane positioned a z = -dist with size
    (width, height).

    We currently only support pinhole perspective cameras. This class could
    be made into a virtual base class to support other types of cameras
    (e.g. an orthographic camera, or omni-directional camera).

    The camera setup looks something like this, where the
    up vector points out of the screen:

    \verbatim
            top view                         side view
               ^                    up
               |                     ^
               |                     |             _,-'
             width                   |         _,-'   |
          +----|----+     +          |     _,-'       | h

            \  |  /     i |        y +'---------------+-i----->

              eye                                 '-,_|
